                  -PlaybackSteam  # Writes the default playback device's power output on 100 as a stream of <int>
                  -RecordingMeter # Writes the default recording device's power output on 100 as a meter
                  -RecordingSteam # Writes the default recording device's power output on 100 as a stream of <int>
